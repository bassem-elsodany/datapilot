## 🔍 Detailed Prompt Differences

### Section 1: Critical Rules

#### Original (`agent_prompts.py`)
```python
# CRITICAL OPERATIONS RULES (Priority Order)
1. **CONVERSATION CONTEXT FIRST**: Check conversation history to correlate current request with previous operations
2. **NEVER FABRICATE FIELD NAMES**: Use ONLY field names from conversation history or tool results. NEVER guess or create field names.
3. **SOQL ONLY**: Generate SOQL queries, NOT SQL. Use Salesforce SOQL syntax with proper relationship queries and subqueries.
3. **ACTION BIAS**: For Salesforce-related requests, prefer taking action (calling tools) over asking clarification. Only ask for clarification when truly ambiguous.
4. **OUT-OF-SCOPE DETECTION**: If the CURRENT request is not related to Salesforce CRM (objects, metadata, data, relationships, queries), return clarification_needed immediately.
5. **OPERATION WORKFLOW**: Search for objects → Confirm object names → Use confirmed API names for subsequent operations.
5. **USE CONVERSATION CONTEXT**: Leverage previous conversation to resolve ambiguous object names (e.g., "abbrev" + context = "resolved_name").
6. **SMART OBJECT RESOLUTION**:
   - If you have resolved API names from conversation → use them directly for metadata/relationships
   - If you need to find new objects → search for unknown terms only
   - **NEVER** search for objects you already know the API names for
   - **NEVER** make multiple calls of the same operation type
   - Example: Known ["ResolvedObject"] + Unknown ["newterm"] → search(["newterm"]) only
7. **NO AUTO-PAGINATION**: Make ONE operation call and return results immediately. Only paginate when user explicitly requests more.
8. **USE OPERATION RESULTS**: Place the exact structure returned by operations into data_summary. Do NOT reorganize or rename data structures.
9. **JSON OUTPUT**: Always return complete, valid JSON with all required fields.
```

**Token count:** ~350

#### Optimized (`agent_prompts_optimized.py`)
```python
# Core Rules (Priority Order)

1. **CONTEXT FIRST**: Check conversation history before acting
2. **NEVER GUESS**: Use ONLY field names from metadata or conversation history
3. **SOQL SYNTAX**: Generate SOQL (not SQL) with LIMIT clauses
4. **ACTION BIAS**: Prefer taking action over asking clarification (unless truly ambiguous)
5. **ONE OPERATION**: Make single calls, don't auto-paginate unless explicitly requested
6. **EXACT API NAMES**: Use confirmed object names from search results
```

**Token count:** ~80

**Reduction:** 77% fewer tokens, clearer rules

### Section 2: Workflow Guidance

#### Original
```python
# 2) Operation Workflow
**THINK → ACT → OBSERVE → RESPOND**. Keep reasoning internal.

**Object Resolution Process:**
- Generic terms (e.g., "account") → Generate variants → Search for all variants → Confirm API names → Proceed
- User input variations (typos, spaces, cases) → Create multiple search terms → Search comprehensively
- Multiple objects → Search all variants in one call → Confirm both → Proceed

**Input Variation Handling:**
- Generate multiple search variants for user input
- Always include both individual words and combined variations

**Operation Rules:**
- Object search: Use comprehensive search terms including variants, typos, and different formats
- Search returns results → Process results → Make informed next call
- Pagination requests → Call operations with appropriate offset/limit
- Field details requests → Use field details operations, not metadata
- Always use exact API names returned from search operations

**Search Strategy:**
- Cast a wide net with search terms to catch variations
- Include common typos and abbreviations
- Search for both singular and plural forms
- Include spacing variations (with/without spaces/underscores)
```

**Token count:** ~250

#### Optimized
```python
# Workflow Examples

## Example 1: Metadata Query
User: "Show me account fields"
Think: Need Account object → Get metadata
Actions:
1. search_for_sobjects(["account", "accounts"]) → "Account"
2. get_sobject_metadata(["Account"]) → fields list
Response: metadata_query with fields in data_summary

## Example 2: Data Query
User: "Show opportunities closing this month"
Think: Need Opportunity object → Get fields → Build SOQL
Actions:
1. search_for_sobjects(["opportunity", "opportunities"]) → "Opportunity"
2. get_sobject_metadata(["Opportunity"]) → discover CloseDate field
3. execute_soql_query("SELECT Id, Name, CloseDate FROM Opportunity WHERE CloseDate = THIS_MONTH LIMIT 5")
Response: data_query with records_count in data_summary

[2 more examples...]
```

**Token count:** ~200

**Improvement:** Examples show exact behavior, easier to understand

### Section 3: SOQL Rules

#### Original
```python
# 4) SOQL Query Rules
**These rules apply to all SOQL queries, especially for data_query and multi-object queries:**
- **ALWAYS execute ONE SOQL query** with subqueries. NEVER make multiple separate SOQL queries.
- **NEVER GUESS or FABRICATE field names**: Always use field names discovered from metadata.  # DUPLICATE!
- **ALWAYS include LIMIT clause**: Default LIMIT 5, maximum LIMIT 10 in SOQL queries.
- **Use ACTUAL relationship query names** from relationship metadata in subqueries, not object names.

**DO:**
- Use a single query with subqueries for related records.
- Use real field names from metadata results.
- Use proper relationship query names for subqueries.
- Apply a LIMIT clause (default 5, max 10).

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Never make multiple separate queries for related objects.
- ❌ Never use object names in subqueries (use relationship query names).
- ❌ Never guess field names, always get metadata first.
- ❌ Never omit the LIMIT clause.

**Examples:**
- "objects with related records" → ONE query with subqueries and LIMIT clause
  Example: `SELECT Id, Name, (SELECT Id, Name FROM RelatedObject__r) FROM Object__c LIMIT 5`
- Subqueries must use the ACTUAL relationship field names from relationship metadata, not object names.
```

**Token count:** ~300

#### Optimized
```python
**SOQL Queries:**
- ALWAYS get metadata first (discover real field names)
- Include LIMIT clause: default 5, max 10
- Use relationship query names for subqueries (from get_sobject_relationships)
- ONE query with subqueries, never multiple queries

[Shown via Example 4: Multi-Object Query with Subquery]
```

**Token count:** ~50 (+ example)

**Improvement:** No duplication, integrated into examples

## ⚙️ Node Comparison

### call_model_node

#### Original (`call_model_node.py`)
```python
def call_model_node(state: WorkflowState, config: RunnableConfig) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Call the LLM with current messages and return AI response."""

    # ... setup code ...

    # Call LLM (SYNCHRONOUS - blocks event loop)
    response = model_with_tools.invoke(messages, config)

    return {
        "messages": messages + [response],
        "remaining_steps": remaining_steps - 1
    }
```

**Execution:** Synchronous, blocking

#### Optimized (`call_model_node_async.py`)
```python
async def call_model_node(state: WorkflowState, config: RunnableConfig) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Call the LLM with current messages and return AI response (ASYNC)."""

    # ... setup code ...

    # Try to use optimized prompts with fallback
    try:
        from app.ai_agent.workflow.prompts.agent_prompts_optimized import AgentPromptsOptimized
        AgentPrompts = AgentPromptsOptimized
    except ImportError:
        from app.ai_agent.workflow.prompts import AgentPrompts

    # Call LLM (ASYNCHRONOUS - non-blocking)
    response = await model_with_tools.ainvoke(messages, config)

    return {
        "messages": messages + [response],
        "remaining_steps": remaining_steps - 1
    }
```

**Execution:** Asynchronous, non-blocking
**Bonus:** Automatic fallback to original prompts

---

### tool_node

#### Original (`tool_node.py`)
```python
def tool_node(state: WorkflowState, config: Optional[RunnableConfig] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Execute tools based on tool calls from the LLM."""

    # ... setup code ...

    outputs = []
    client_results = []

    # SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION
    for tool_call in last_message.tool_calls:
        tool_args = tool_call["args"].copy()
        tool_args["connection_uuid"] = connection_uuid

        # Execute tool (BLOCKS until complete)
        if config:
            tool_result = tools_by_name[tool_call["name"]].invoke(tool_args, config)
        else:
            tool_result = tools_by_name[tool_call["name"]].invoke(tool_args)

        # ... process result ...

    return {"messages": messages + outputs, "client_results": client_results}
```

**Execution:** Sequential (one tool at a time)
**Example timing:** 2 tools × 2s each = **4s total**

#### Optimized (`tool_node_async.py`)
```python
async def tool_node(state: WorkflowState, config: Optional[RunnableConfig] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Execute tools based on tool calls from the LLM (ASYNC with parallel execution)."""

    # ... setup code ...

    tool_calls = last_message.tool_calls

    # PARALLEL EXECUTION (if multiple tools)
    if len(tool_calls) > 1:
        logger.debug(f"Executing {len(tool_calls)} tools in parallel")
        results = await asyncio.gather(*[
            _execute_single_tool(tool_call, connection_uuid, config)
            for tool_call in tool_calls
        ])
    else:
        results = [await _execute_single_tool(tool_calls[0], connection_uuid, config)]

    # ... process results ...

    return {"messages": messages + outputs, "client_results": client_results}


async def _execute_single_tool(tool_call, connection_uuid, config):
    """Execute a single tool call asynchronously."""
    tool_args = tool_call["args"].copy()
    tool_args["connection_uuid"] = connection_uuid

    # Execute tool asynchronously
    if config:
        tool_result = await tools_by_name[tool_call["name"]].ainvoke(tool_args, config)
    else:
        tool_result = await tools_by_name[tool_call["name"]].ainvoke(tool_args)

    # ... process and return ...
```

**Execution:** Parallel (all tools simultaneously)
**Example timing:** 2 tools × 2s each = **~2s total** (46% faster!)
