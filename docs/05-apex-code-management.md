## Overview

**ðŸš§ Feature Under Development** - DataPilot's Apex Code Management system is currently under active development. Both the backend API infrastructure and frontend UI components are partially implemented and still being built. This documentation outlines our planned comprehensive Apex development capabilities with advanced code execution, compilation, testing, and debugging features.

**Current Status:**
- ðŸš§ **Backend API**: Partially implemented - basic anonymous Apex execution and REST endpoints exist but need completion
- ðŸš§ **Frontend UI**: Under development - ApexTab component exists but needs completion
- ðŸ“‹ **Planned Features**: Advanced code editor, testing framework, debugging tools, and collaboration features

## Planned Key Capabilities

### Advanced Apex Execution (Partially Implemented)
- **Anonymous Apex Execution**: ðŸš§ Basic implementation - Run Apex code directly in Salesforce
- **Apex REST Integration**: ðŸš§ Basic implementation - Execute custom REST endpoints  
- **Code Compilation**: ðŸ“‹ Planned - Package and trigger compilation
- **Test Execution**: ðŸ“‹ Planned - Apex test coverage and debugging
- **Debug Level Management**: ðŸ“‹ Planned - Advanced debugging and logging

### Development Tools (Under Development)
- **Code Editor**: ðŸš§ In Progress - Advanced Apex code editor with syntax highlighting
- **Code Templates**: ðŸ“‹ Planned - Pre-built Apex code templates and snippets
- **Version Control**: ðŸ“‹ Planned - Track code changes and iterations
- **Collaborative Development**: ðŸ“‹ Planned - Team-based code development

### Testing and Debugging (Planned)
- **Test Execution**: ðŸ“‹ Planned - Run Apex tests with coverage reporting
- **Debug Logging**: ðŸ“‹ Planned - Advanced debugging and log analysis
- **Performance Monitoring**: ðŸ“‹ Planned - Code execution performance tracking
- **Error Analysis**: ðŸ“‹ Planned - Comprehensive error detection and resolution

## Current Implementation Status

### Backend API (Partially Implemented)
```
Code Input â†’ Salesforce Tooling API â†’ Execution â†’ Result Processing â†’ Response
```

**Partially Implemented Components:**
- **Apex Executor**: ðŸš§ Basic anonymous Apex code execution via Salesforce Tooling API
- **REST Integrator**: ðŸš§ Basic Apex REST endpoint execution with request/response handling
- **Limits Monitor**: ðŸ“‹ Planned - Apex governor limits tracking and monitoring
- **Error Handling**: ðŸš§ Basic error detection and reporting

### Frontend UI (Under Development)
**Current State:**
- **ApexTab Component**: Basic structure exists but needs completion
- **Code Editor**: Textarea placeholder - needs Monaco Editor integration
- **Execution Interface**: UI framework ready but needs API integration
- **Result Display**: Modal structure exists but needs result processing

*This documentation outlines the planned Apex Code Management feature. The backend API infrastructure is complete, but the frontend UI is under development. This feature will provide comprehensive Apex development capabilities with advanced code execution, compilation, testing, and debugging features.*
